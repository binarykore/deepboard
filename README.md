# Deep Board:

* Deep Board - Is a Type of URN (Url Redirect Notification) and DRM (Data Ranking Module) using IP Address and Geo Tagging as a Form of Advert into your own Platform..

* It uses IP Address and Geo Tagging, example: SG Customers clicks or visits will receive the Adverts from the Singapore (SG) based App using only Web Vitals like IP Address, Headers and Referrers from the Requesting User..

* It is used Primarily by my own App / Platform to target Geographic based Users from specific Audience if by means you are from Singapore (App / Page) just an example then all clicks will receive the same amount if you are from the same Location (which is Singapore)..
